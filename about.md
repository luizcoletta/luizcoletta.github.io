I am a data scientist and researcher dealing with theoretical and applied problems of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). For over 14 years, I have been researching and developing AI/ML methods and algorithms for areas such as Sentiment Analysis, Computer Vision, Predictive Analytics, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I have published my work in prestigious journals, such as IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, Elsevier Information Sciences, ACM Computing Surveys, and Elsevier Neurocomputing.

I joined OCTO Research Office at Dell in 2022 and, since then, I have conducted several research studies and projects based on cutting-edge AI/ML techniques. Most of them involve topics such as Anomaly/Novelty Detection, AI Reasoning, Continual Learning, Federated Learning, Data Fusion, Edge Intelligence, and Language Models.

Previously, I was Associate Professor at School of Sciences and Engineering (FCE) of the São Paulo State University (UNESP/Tupã) and was with the Electrical Engineering Graduate program (PPGEE/UNESP/Sorocaba-SJBV), where I advised students and taught courses. I was a member of [H.IAAC - Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures Hub](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/en/){:target="_blank"} based at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), where I did my post-doctorate researching Cognitive Architectures.

In 2016, I won 1st place in the X Competition of Thesis and Dissertations in Artificial and Computational Intelligence at the 5th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent System (BRACIS 2016). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2015 at Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences (ICMC) of the University of Sao Paulo (USP), São Carlos/Brazil, where I also received my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in 2011, and my B.Sc. degree in Computer Information Systems in 2009.

My main interests are in Machine Learning (e.g., Semi-supervised Learning, Ensembles, Classification, and Clustering), including those Bio-inspired Computing techniques (e.g., Evolutionary and Genetic Algorithms, Metaheuristics, and shallow/deep Artificial Neural Networks: MLPs, CNNs, GANs, Transformers, etc.).

Because of my [previous academic research](https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/auxilios/99479/deteccao-de-padroes-em-plantacoes-a-partir-da-combinacao-de-classificadores-e-agrupadores-de-dados/) on Agriculture 4.0/5.0, involving crop monitoring for threat detection, I have become a drone pilot!
